# Ant Colony Optimization for Traveling Salesman Problem

This project implements an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to solve the classic Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The program is written in Java and aims to find an approximate solution to the TSP, which is a well-known NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization.

## Features

- Utilizes Ant Colony Optimization algorithm to find approximate solutions to TSP.
- Allows customization of parameters such as number of ants, pheromone evaporation rate, and number of iterations.
- Provides output of the best solution found.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/bit-yottabyte/ant-colony-optimization.git
```

2. Compile the Java files:

```
cd AntColonyOptimization
javac *.java
```

3. Run the program:

```
java Main
```

4. Follow the prompts to input the TSP dataset file path and adjust any desired parameters.

5. View the output of the best solution found.
